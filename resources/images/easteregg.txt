Hi! Youve just found an easter egg!
Sorry, there's no candy in here. You'd have better luck at Walmart though.
But, here's a poem:

Amazing corporations
Never cheat their customers
Do not try to understand this
Realize your significance
Everyone has one
What is yours?

Oh...

See! I told you.
And you believed me
Yes, you did
Say thanks later.

How wonderful!
I like it!
